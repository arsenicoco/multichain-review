#Bootstrap Scala application

This is a simple bit of code, still WIP, that I started to put together to allow more easy interaction with MultiChain's API for some of the experiments I was running. Unfortunately, it is only partially completed, but allows for some basic commands to be run against the API.

It provides an interactive shell. To run it, use SBT to download dependencies and compile the code. Some basic information will be printed to the terminal before a prompt appears:

```
$ sbt run

...
some useful information

exp> help
```
